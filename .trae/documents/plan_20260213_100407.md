I will upgrade the **Service Tracker** in the Nurse Portal to fully align with the Admin Panel's logic while maintaining a mobile-first experience.

### 1. Update Nurse Portal Service (`nurse-portal.service.ts`)
I will add the missing API methods to interact with the same backend endpoints as the Admin Panel:
*   `getServiceDefinitions()`: To fetch the official list of services (e.g., "Wound Dressing", "Insulin").
*   `getServiceReminders(patientId)`: To see what tasks are scheduled.
*   `addServiceReminder(data)`: To schedule a new task/reminder.

### 2. Refactor Service Tracker UI (`ServiceTracker.tsx`)
I will transform the current simple list into a robust dual-tab system:

*   **Tab 1: History (Performed Services)**
    *   **Logic:** Shows services *already done* (synced with Patient/Admin history).
    *   **Add Action:** "Register Performed Service"
        *   **Form:** Will now use a **Dropdown** to select the exact Service Type (instead of typing a title manually), ensuring data consistency.
        *   **Fields:** Service Type, Time, Description, Notes.

*   **Tab 2: Upcoming (Reminders)**
    *   **Logic:** Shows *scheduled* tasks (Reminders) for the patient.
    *   **Add Action:** "Schedule New Reminder"
        *   **Form:** A mobile-friendly bottom sheet to set a future task.
        *   **Fields:** Service Type, Date/Time, Priority.

### 3. Mobile-First UX Improvements
*   **Bottom Sheet Forms:** All data entry will happen in smooth, slide-up panels (already in use, but expanded).
*   **Smart Defaults:** "Time" will default to now for performed services.
*   **Visual Consistency:** Use the same icons and color coding (Green for completed, Blue for scheduled) as the Admin Panel.

This approach ensures that **any service registered by a nurse immediately appears in the Admin Panel** with the correct type and structure, and vice versa.
