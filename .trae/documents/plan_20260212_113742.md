I have implemented the Nursing Reports feature in the Nurse Portal with a mobile-first design, matching the Admin Panel's data structure.

### 1. New Components

* **`ReportWriter`**: A smart, mobile-optimized 3-step wizard for creating reports.

  * **Step 1**: Select Shift (Morning, Evening, Night) and Report Category (e.g., General, Vital Signs).

  * **Step 2**: Interactive Checklist with expand/collapse logic for sub-items.

  * **Step 3**: Review generated text and submit.

* **`PatientSelector`**: A clean, searchable modal to select a patient before writing a report.

### 2. Integration Points

* **Dashboard (Quick Access)**: The "Report Writing" button now opens the Patient Selector, allowing nurses to quickly start a report for any patient.

* **Reports Page**: Added a Floating Action Button (FAB) (+) at the bottom left to create a new report from the global reports list.

### 3. Backend Alignment

* Updated `nursePortalService` to use the `SubmitNursingReportDto`, ensuring the data format matches exactly what the backend expects (including structured checklist items), consistent with the Admin Panel.

### Files Created/Modified

* `frontend/src/components/nurse-portal/report-writer.tsx` (Rewritten)

* `frontend/src/components/nurse-portal/PatientSelector.tsx` (New
