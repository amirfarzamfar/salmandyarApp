I will implement the **Vital Signs** module in the Nurse Portal with a structure mirroring the Admin Panel but optimized for mobile (Mobile-First) and User Experience (UX).

### 1. Refactor & Create `VitalSignsTracker` Component
I will create a new, comprehensive component `frontend/src/components/nurse-portal/vital-signs-tracker.tsx` that replaces the simple `vitals-manager.tsx`.
*   **Modes:**
    *   **Global Mode:** Lists all patients with their **latest recorded vital signs** (BP, Pulse, Temp, SpO2) in a card view.
    *   **Patient Mode:** Shows full **history** of vital signs and **Charts** for the selected patient.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Add/Edit Form:** A mobile-friendly Bottom Sheet form (using `react-hook-form` and `zod`) for validating and submitting data.
    *   **Charts:** Integrated charts (reusing `VitalsChart`) to visualize trends.
    *   **Alerts:** Visual indicators for abnormal values (e.g., high BP, low SpO2) based on medical thresholds.
*   **UI/UX:**
    *   "Ultra-Premium" design with smooth animations (`framer-motion`).
    *   Touch-friendly inputs and large tap targets.

### 2. Create Vital Signs Page
I will create `frontend/src/app/nurse-portal/vital-signs/page.tsx`.
*   This page will host the `VitalSignsTracker` in **Global Mode**, allowing nurses to see a snapshot of all patients' vitals and quickly drill down or add new records.

### 3. Update Sidebar Navigation
I will update `frontend/src/components/nurse-portal/sidebar.tsx` to include the **"Vital Signs" (علائم حیاتی)** link with the `Activity` icon, placing it logically within the menu.

### 4. Dashboard Quick Action
I will update `frontend/src/app/nurse-portal/page.tsx` to add a **"Quick Vital Signs" (ثبت علائم حیاتی)** button in the Quick Actions section.
*   **Workflow:** Clicking the button will open a **Patient Selector**.
*   **Action:** Selecting a patient will immediately open the **Add Vital Signs Form** for that patient, streamlining the workflow.

### 5. Backend Integration
I will verify and use the existing endpoints:
*   `GET /patients/{id}/vitals`: To fetch history.
*   `POST /patients/{id}/vitals`: To add new records.
*   *Note: If a "Get All Patients Vitals" endpoint is missing, I will aggregate data efficiently in the frontend or create a specialized endpoint if needed (sticking to frontend aggregation for now as per previous patterns).*
