I will implement the changes to remove the ID display and add the "Full Details" functionality as requested.

### 1. Create New Component: `ReportDetailsModal`
I will create a new file `frontend/src/components/nurse-portal/ReportDetailsModal.tsx` to display the full report details.
- **Design:** It will use the same modal style as `PatientSelector` and `ReportWriter` (dark overlay, centered card) for consistency.
- **Content:**
    - **Header:** Patient Name, Date, Shift (with badges).
    - **Body:** The full report text content in a scrollable area.
    - **Footer:** A close button.
- **Props:** `isOpen`, `onClose`, and `report` object.

### 2. Modify `NurseReportsPage`
I will update `frontend/src/app/nurse-portal/reports/page.tsx`:
- **Remove ID:** Delete the HTML element displaying `ID: {report.careRecipientId}`.
- **Add State:** Introduce a state variable `viewReport` to track which report is currently being viewed.
- **Connect Button:** Update the "جزئیات کامل" (Full Details) button to set the `viewReport` state when clicked.
- **Render Modal:** Add the `<ReportDetailsModal />` component to the page, controlled by the `viewReport` state.

This approach ensures the "Full Details" feature works smoothly without cluttering the main list, and the UI remains clean without the internal ID.
