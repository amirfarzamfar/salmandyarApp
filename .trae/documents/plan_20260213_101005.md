I noticed you have `frontend/src/app/nurse-portal/reports/page.tsx` open, but your message content appears to be a system ID. 

However, I see a comment in the code indicating that `framer-motion` was **"Temporarily removed to debug visibility issues"**.

If your goal is to fix this or work on this file, here is a proposed plan:

## 1. Restore and Debug Animations
- Uncomment `framer-motion` import.
- Convert the report list items back to `motion.div` components.
- Investigate and fix the visibility issue (likely related to initial layout state or opacity settings).

## 2. Verification
- Ensure the reports list renders correctly on load.
- Verify animations work without hiding the content.

**If you had a different task in mind, please let me know!**
