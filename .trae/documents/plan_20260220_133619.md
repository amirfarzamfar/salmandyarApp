I will fix the issue where "Planned Services" in the Patient Panel are static and not updating. This involves changes to both the backend (to trigger real-time updates) and the frontend (to display the correct data).

### Backend Changes
1.  **Modify `IPatientService` and `PatientService`**:
    *   Update `UpdateCareServiceAsync` and `DeleteCareServiceAsync` to return `Task<int>` instead of `Task`. This will allow them to return the `CareRecipientId` of the affected service.
    *   This is necessary because the Controller needs to know *which* patient to notify via SignalR, and the Controller doesn't have the `CareRecipientId` for update/delete operations (only the `ServiceId`).

2.  **Update `PatientsController`**:
    *   Inject `IHubContext<ServiceHub>` to enable sending real-time notifications.
    *   In `AddService`, `UpdateService`, and `DeleteService`, trigger the `ReceiveServiceUpdate` event via SignalR to the specific patient group (`Patient_{id}`).
    *   Use the returned `CareRecipientId` from the service methods to target the correct patient.

### Frontend Changes
1.  **Update `CarePlanCards.tsx`**:
    *   Currently, this component *only* fetches "Reminders" (`ServiceReminder`), which is why it misses the actual "Planned Services" (`CareService`) created by nurses.
    *   Modify it to also fetch `CareServices` using `nursePortalService.getPatientServices(patientId)`.
    *   Filter for services with status `Planned` or `Upcoming`.
    *   Display these services in the list, providing a complete view of the patient's care plan.
    *   Ensure the component re-fetches both lists when a SignalR update is received.

### Verification
*   I will verify that adding a service in the Nurse Panel immediately updates the Patient Panel without a page refresh.
*   I will verify that "Planned Services" now shows the actual care services, not just reminders.
