I will implement the **Edit** and **Delete** functionality for medications in both the Admin and Nurse portals, strictly following **Mobile-First** design principles and ensuring full responsiveness without affecting existing layouts.

### 1. Backend Implementation (C#)
*   **Service Layer (`MedicationService.cs` & `IMedicationService.cs`):**
    *   Implement `UpdateMedicationAsync`: Will update medication details. If scheduling parameters (Frequency, Start Date) change, it will intelligently regenerate future scheduled doses.
    *   Implement `DeleteMedicationAsync`: Will delete the medication record. *Safety Check:* If the medication has already been administered (has history), it will prevent deletion to preserve medical records.
*   **Controller (`MedicationsController.cs`):**
    *   Add `PUT /api/medications/{id}` endpoint for updates.
    *   Add `DELETE /api/medications/{id}` endpoint for deletion.

### 2. Frontend Implementation (React/Next.js) - Mobile-First & Responsive
*   **API Service (`medications.service.ts`):**
    *   Add `updateMedication` and `deleteMedication` functions connecting to the new backend endpoints.
*   **UI Components:**
    *   **`MedicationCard.tsx` (Responsive):**
        *   Add **Edit** (Pencil icon) and **Delete** (Trash icon) buttons with a modern, clean look.
        *   **Mobile Optimization:** Ensure touch targets are large enough (min 44px) and icons are easily accessible on small screens. Use `flex-wrap` to prevent layout breakage.
        *   **Delete Action:** Integrate `SweetAlert2` for a responsive confirmation dialog.
    *   **`MedicationWizard.tsx` (The Add/Edit Modal):**
        *   Upgrade this component to support **Edit Mode** (accept `initialData`).
        *   **Responsive Design:** Verify and adjust modal width (`w-full`, `max-w-4xl`) and padding (`p-4` on mobile, `p-8` on desktop) to ensure it looks perfect on all devices.
        *   Ensure form fields stack vertically on mobile for better readability.
    *   **`MedicationsTab.tsx` / `PatientMedicationList.tsx`:**
        *   Manage the state for "Editing Medication" to open the Wizard with the correct data.
        *   Ensure the list layout adapts gracefully (single column on mobile, grid on desktop).

This approach guarantees a seamless and robust experience across all devices while maintaining the integrity of the existing system.
