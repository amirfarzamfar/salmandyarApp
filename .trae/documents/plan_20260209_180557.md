I will implement the **User Assessment Management** module to allow admins to assign, track, and review assessments for users.

### Backend Implementation (.NET 8)

1.  **Domain Layer**:
    - Create `AssessmentAssignment` entity to link `User` and `AssessmentForm` with fields: `AssignedDate`, `Deadline`, `IsMandatory`, `Status` (Pending, InProgress, Completed, Expired), and `SubmissionId`.
    - Create `AssessmentAssignmentStatus` enum.
    - Update `AssessmentSubmission` to link back to `AssessmentAssignment` if needed (or rely on `AssessmentAssignment.SubmissionId`).

2.  **Infrastructure Layer**:
    - Update `SalmandyarDbContext` to include `AssessmentAssignments`.
    - Create `AssessmentAssignmentService` to handle:
        - Assigning assessments (with overlap/duplicate checks).
        - Retrieving user assignments with status.
        - Calculating/updating status (e.g., marking Expired).

3.  **API Layer**:
    - Create `AssessmentAssignmentsController` with endpoints:
        - `POST /assign`: Assign an assessment to a user.
        - `GET /users`: Get all users with their assessment summary (Count of Assigned/Completed).
        - `GET /user/{userId}/assignments`: Get detailed list of assignments for a user.
        - `GET /assignment/{id}`: Get details of a specific assignment (including results if completed).

### Frontend Implementation (Next.js)

1.  **Service Layer**:
    - Create `assessment-assignment.service.ts` to interact with the new API endpoints.

2.  **Admin UI Components**:
    - **Page**: Create `/dashboard/admin/assessments/user-assignments/page.tsx`.
    - **Components**:
        - `UserListTable`: Displays users with filters (Role, Active Status) and a summary of their assessment status.
        - `UserAssignmentHistory`: A detailed view (modal or expandable row) showing all assessments for a selected user.
        - `AssignAssessmentModal`: A form to assign a new assessment (Select Assessment, Set Deadline, Mandatory toggle).
        - `AssessmentResultView`: A detailed view to inspect a completed assessment (Questions, User Answers, Scores, Weights).

3.  **Navigation**:
    - Add "مدیریت آزمون کاربران" (User Assessment Management) to the Admin Sidebar under "Assessment Management".

### Verification
- Verify that assignments can be created and appear in the user's list.
- Verify that the status updates correctly (e.g., when a submission is linked).
- Verify that answers and scores are displayed correctly in the detail view.
