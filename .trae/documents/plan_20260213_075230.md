I will modify `frontend/src/app/nurse-portal/reports/page.tsx` to:

1. **Remove the ID Display:**

   * Delete the code block displaying `ID: {report.careRecipientId}` from the report card.

2. **Implement "Full Details" (جزئیات کامل):**

   * Add a new state `selectedReport` to track the report being viewed.

   * Add an `onClick` handler to the "Full Details" button to set the `selectedReport`.

   * Create a **Detail Modal** that renders when a report is selected. This modal will:

     * Overlay the screen with a blurred backdrop (z-index 100).

     * Display the full report content in a scrollable view.

     * Show report metadata (Patient Name, Shift, Date, Author).

     * Include a "Close" button to dismiss the modal.
